Github: https://github.com/nagfx/progummyv2

Video demonstration: https://youtu.be/ecIG_Fq5f9M

Once you open the Github link the readme.md has instructions and details but I am copying pasting here too

After you clone the git open terminal https://github.com/nagfx/progummyv2.git on your vscode and cd into the cloned directory, and write npm install, then npm start

Then access on localhost:3000 from different browsers. You can drag on one browser and it will automatically reflect the same changes on the other browser.

It is deployed here using free server, slow specs server so a bit of lag will be observed https://comfortable-wind-peacock.glitch.me/

Technologies used

Front-end: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Back-end: Node.js and Express.js for server-side programming.

Socket.io for real-time communication between the browsers.
